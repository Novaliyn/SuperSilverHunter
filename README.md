process: so i got the idea when friends came over, came up with. someone collecting silver. this is my first godot game, its been really fun so far. there is definitely alot more to learn! started small with different objects, then as i got to know the software more, i was able to start coding things like gravity orbs, or even the transportation rings. Im greatful for my friends for helping with the textures, and if i ever got really stuck on coding, the level switching was a challenge!
